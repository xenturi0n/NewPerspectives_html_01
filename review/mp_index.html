            <p>Mobile Panini is the culmination of the dream of Antonio and Carmen
            Dolcini, who came to America looking to serve people the
            authentic recipes learned from their Sicilian family.</p>
            
            <p>Antonio began work as a child in his grandmother's deli where he
            learned the age-old secrets of Sicilian cooking. He refined his
            technique at the Culinary Institute of Milan. His younger brother,
            Carmen, with no less of a love for cooking and good food, also
            worked in the deli and became well-acquainted with the open-air
            fresh food markets of his home town. Carmen too, is a proud
            graduate of the Culinary Institute of Milan.</p>
            
            <p>Now you can enjoy what they have learned and mastered, right outside 
            your door; but with no compromises in freshness or delicacy of preparation.
